# Movie Recommender System

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`movie_recommender.ipynb`) implementing a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. It walks through data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation, demonstrating how to generate personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Exploration**  
  Load movie ratings and metadata, explore distributions and sparsity.

- **Preprocessing**  
  Clean and transform rating data into user-item matrices.

- **Modeling**  
  Build collaborative filtering models (e.g., matrix factorization, KNN-based approaches).

- **Evaluation**  
  Evaluate recommender performance using metrics like RMSE.

- **Usage Examples**  
  Generate top-N movie recommendations for sample users.
